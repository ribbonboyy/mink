            <h2>The Manifesto Behind prettyfunny.xyz</h2>
            <p>
                prettyfunny.xyz started as a personal project back when I was in 7th grade.
                What began as simple curiosity quickly turned into an obsession with how websites are made.
            </p>
            <p>
                With nothing more than a GitHub account and a strong Wi-Fi connection, I launched the site completely hosted via GitHub Pages.
                It was a mix of trial and error, late-night Googling, and sheer determination.
            </p>
            <p>
                The internet felt like a giant playground, and I was eager to build my own corner of it.
                Every HTML tag, every CSS tweak—it all felt like magic. And prettyfunny.xyz became the space where I could experiment and share that magic.
            </p>
            <p>
                This site isn’t just a domain—it's a memory of youthful curiosity, a living experiment, and a place that reminds me why I love building things on the web.
            </p>
            <p>
                Built with passion, mistakes, learning, and lots of coffee (eventually ☕).
            </p>
            <p>
                Still hosted <strong>100% on GitHub</strong>—because that’s where it all began.
