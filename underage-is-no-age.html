            <ul>

            <h2>Why Underage People Can Say Things They Don't Mean</h2>
            <p>When chatting online, it's easy to forget that real people are behind the screen. Young people may feel pressured to say things just to fit in or avoid rejection, even if those words don’t reflect their true feelings. This can lead to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Regretting something said online after seeing the impact it has on others.</li>
                <li>Feeling emotionally burdened by online arguments or harsh words.</li>
                <li>Experiencing social anxiety or fear of being judged by others for things they said online.</li>
            </ul>
