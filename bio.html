            <p>
                My name is Matthew and I made prettyfunny.xyz. I created a Discord account for a school friend group. Since then, I’ve become invested in the nerdy stuff Discord and most websites are built on. I started learning using some basic resources and made a lot of mistakes, which taught me how to write proper scripts. 
                Now, I embrace being an internet nerd. While I excel in most classes (except math, which I dislike), I spend a lot of time online. I later down the line reached 100,000 monthly active players on Roblox and 1 plus 1 is 2 and all of a sudden I have 3,000,000 millions visits on my game. I know CSS+HTML js and luau. 
                I am currently taken by a man :D. But enough of personal, my first really big moderator position was in the community server for ammo.lol (a biolink service) but I have left the server. My next notable was Yapcord where I was an administrator and I am currently a moderator in boykisser zone. Outside of a goated Discord moderator
                I am a Roblox Developer that has hit success actually pretty recently. I currently sit at 1.9M straightly under my name and 5M+ which I have helped with.
