            <h2>Organizational Structure</h2>
            <p>Junák operates through a structured system of local groups, units (called "oddíly"), and patrols. This framework allows Scouts to experience personal progression and take on leadership roles gradually, often starting from young Cub Scouts all the way to leading teams and organizing camps as Rovers and adult volunteers.</p>
            <p>Each unit organizes regular weekly meetings, weekend trips, and large-scale summer camps. The camps are a highlight of the year, allowing Scouts to live in nature for two or three weeks, cook over a fire, learn traditional skills, and bond as a team.</p>

These opportunities offer cultural exchange, broaden perspectives, and strengthen global peace and friendship through shared Scouting values.</p>
