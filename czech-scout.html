            <h2>Structure and Activities</h2>
            <p>Scouts are grouped by age into categories like Cub Scouts (vlčata), Scouts (skauti), and Rovers (roverstvo). Each group is part of a larger local unit and typically organizes weekly meetings, weekend trips, and a multi-week summer camp.</p>
            <p>Camp life is one of the most valued experiences. Tents, campfires, outdoor cooking, games, and learning traditional skills like knots, tracking, or first aid are all part of it. Over time, Scouts gradually take on more responsibility, often becoming leaders for younger members.</p>
